2. Low Accidents in Summer and Higher Accidents on Winter

3. New york data: Total number of accidents are 21699. 
The count is lower even being the most populated city because of following reason:
a) Urban infrastructure: Urban areas like New York City often have better road infrastructure, more emergency services, and more                          frequent law enforcement. 
b) Community attitudes: Local cultures and attitudes towards safety measures can play a big role in road safety. For example,                           states with lower seatbelt usage rates tend to have higher fatality rates
